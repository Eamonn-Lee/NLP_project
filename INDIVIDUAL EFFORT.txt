Eddie Zhang (z5481990):
    - Developed salary_baseline model
    - Developed non-finetuned salary solution using BiLSTM+CRF (on local branch)
    - Wrote non-finetuned salary section of the report
    - Wrote project scope, introduction and conclusion of the report
    - Collated and edited team presentation
    - Collated and edited team report

Rubik Liu (z5564105):
    - Developed salary_baseline model
    - Developed non fine-tuned salary solution using BERT (on local branch)
    - Developed fine-tuned salary solution using T5-base model
    - Wrote salary baseline section of the report
    - Wrote fine-tuned salary section of the report
    - Demonstrate the salary baseline part in presentation
    - Demonstrate the salary fine-tuning part in presentation
    - Demonstrate the gradio of salary model in presentation
    - Compare and discuss three salary fine-tuned models in reports and presentations.


Yiming Zhou (z5462488):
    Developed the salary_baseline model based on Eddie Rubik's work, improving the salary prediction accuracy from 66% to 84%.
    wa_baseline_v2
    seniority_baseline
    Built and fine-tuned multiple models for salary prediction tasks, including:
        salary_nft_RoBERTa
        salary_nft_BERT
        salary_nft_mT5
        salary_ft_RoBERTa
        salary_ft_mT5
    Designed and implemented a Gradio demo to visualize the salary prediction results.
    Built the WA_FT_RoBERTa model for work arrangement classification.
    Completed the full workflow for all models listed above, including training, prediction, and evaluation.

    Manually labeled a dataset of 1900 entries for the salary extraction task.
    Conducted error detection on the original development dataset, identified 133 erroneous samples, and removed them to improve dataset quality.
    WA baseline model and results for presentation.
